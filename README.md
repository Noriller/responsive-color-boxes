# Responsive Color Boxes | Bruno Noriller

Project made with React and Vite.

- React: personal preference
- Vite: it had been a while since I used it

## What's going on here

There's two breakpoints: up to 600px and higher.

Each render nine boxes in a different layout.

On every render, a random color is generated for each box.

Complementary to that, a contrast font color is used.

Every time you click on a box, the color of all the boxes are changed.

## How to use

### Dev

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

### Production

To create a production bundle in the `dist` folder.

```bash
yarn install
yarn build
```

Then, `preview` to serve it.

```bash
yarn preview
```
